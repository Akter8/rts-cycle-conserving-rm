## Doubts

## Tasks left

## Things to bear in mind

* Call the scheduler only when there is a decision point-- arrival or termination.
* Schedule till min(3 * hyperperiod, first in-phase time + hyperperiod)
* Only periodic jobs execute. They execute for 50-100% of the wcet.
* Implicit deadlines for jobs.
* Output: response times (min, max, avg), response time jitters (relative and absolute), waiting times (min, max, avg).
